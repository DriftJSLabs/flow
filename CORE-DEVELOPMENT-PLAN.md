## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Patterns
- **Monorepo Structure**: Use Turborepo for efficient package management
- **Plugin Architecture**: Design extensible ORM and database adapters
- **Command Pattern**: Implement commands as separate modules with shared interfaces
- **Strategy Pattern**: Use for different enhancement strategies per operation type
- **Observer Pattern**: For progress tracking and event handling

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety across all packages
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer pure functions for SQL analysis and enhancement
- **Error Handling**: Use Result types for operation outcomes
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage with unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc for all public APIs

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load ORM adapters and database drivers on demand
- **Caching**: Cache database metadata and analysis results
- **Streaming**: Use streams for large file processing
- **Batching**: Implement efficient batching for database operations
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage for large migration processing

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Framework Setup
- **Primary**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **CLI Testing**: Use subprocess execution with controlled environments
- **Database Testing**: Docker containers for isolated database testing
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (databases, file systems)

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function and class testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Package interaction testing  
3. **CLI Tests**: Full command-line interface testing
4. **Database Tests**: Real database operation testing
5. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
