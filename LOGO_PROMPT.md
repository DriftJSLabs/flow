# Logo Generation Prompt for Drift

## **Primary Goal:**
Create a single, square-shaped logo for "Drift," a sophisticated software development tool that automates and simplifies database migrations.

## **Core Concepts to Convey:**
*   **Drift & Flow:** The logo must embody the concept of smooth, controlled, and continuous movement, representing the seamless flow of data and schema changes.
*   **Database & Structure:** It should subtly hint at database structures, like layers, tables, or data streams, without being overly literal.
*   **Automation & Precision:** The design should feel precise, intelligent, and almost magical in its efficiency, reflecting the tool's automation capabilities.

## **Detailed Art Style & Visual Guidelines:**

*   **Style:** Modern, minimalist, and abstract. The design should be clean, geometric, and feel at home in a high-tech, premium software environment. Think of the elegance and simplicity of logos like Linear, Vercel, or Stripe.
*   **Shape & Form:**
    *   The overall composition must be a perfect square.
    *   The central icon should be composed of clean, geometric shapes (lines, arcs, circles, or simplified polygons).
    *   Incorporate a sense of dynamic movement. This could be achieved through swirling lines that suggest a vortex or a gentle current, or through a series of layered shapes that imply a smooth transition or "drift" from one state to another.
    *   A subtle visual metaphor for a database could be a stack of slightly offset, thin horizontal layers or a stylized, abstract representation of a data cylinder viewed from an isometric perspective.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary Gradient:** The main icon should feature a smooth, luxurious gradient transitioning from a deep, intelligent blue to a vibrant, futuristic purple. Use these specific hex codes for the gradient: `from #667eea to #764ba2`.
    *   **Accent Color:** Introduce a single, sharp accent of a luminous, energetic pink (`#f093fb`) to represent the "spark" of automation or a successful migration. This could be a small dot, a glowing edge, or the tip of a flowing line.
    *   **Background:** The background should be a very dark, near-black charcoal gray (`#111111`) to make the vibrant colors of the icon pop.
*   **Lighting & Effects:**
    *   **Glow:** The icon should have a subtle, soft outer glow, primarily using the purple and pink tones of the palette. This creates a "premium" and "magical" feel, as if the logo is subtly illuminated.
    *   **Glassmorphism (Optional but preferred):** Apply a very subtle glass-like texture or sheen to parts of the icon to give it a sense of depth and a premium, tactile quality.
    *   **Shadows:** No harsh shadows. The logo should feel like it's floating in a digital space. Any depth should come from the layering of shapes and the soft glow.
*   **Composition:**
    *   The icon should be perfectly centered within the square canvas.
    *   Ensure there is ample negative space around the icon to give it room to breathe. The design should feel balanced and uncluttered.
*   **Wordmark (Not included in the square icon):** This prompt is for the **icon only**. No text should be present.

## **Final Output Specification:**
A single, high-resolution, square-shaped image of an abstract, minimalist logo icon. The design must be clean, modern, and embody the concepts of flow, data, and automation using the specified color palette and effects.
