# Task: @driftjs/flow Product Page - Content & Feature Plan

## üéØ Mission Brief
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive and engaging product page for the `@driftjs/flow` CLI tool. This page will serve as the primary marketing and informational resource for `flow`, clearly articulating its value proposition, features, and benefits to attract and convert developers and engineering teams.  
**Type**: Content & Feature Development  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Phase**: 1 of 1 (Product Page Implementation)

## ‚úÖ Todo Task-List

### **Phase 1: Page Structure & Core Content**
- [ ] **Route & Component Setup**
  - [ ] Create new route file at `apps/web/src/routes/flow.tsx`
  - [ ] Develop a `FlowProductPage` component
  - [ ] Integrate the new route into the main navigation and sitemap

- [ ] **Hero Section**
  - [ ] **Headline**: "Database Migrations That Don't Wake You Up at 3 AM"
  - [ ] **Sub-headline**: `@driftjs/flow` is a smart CLI assistant that wraps your existing ORM migrations, automatically enhancing them with production-grade safety patterns to prevent downtime and data loss.
  - [ ] **Interactive Element**: A simulated, auto-playing terminal demonstrating the `npx @driftjs/flow sync` command, showing risk detection and enhancement suggestions.
  - [ ] **Primary CTAs**: "Get Started (npm)" and "Read the Docs"
  - [ ] **Social Proof**: Small logos of supported ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM) and databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) under the CTA.

- [ ] **Problem Statement Section**
  - [ ] **Title**: "Stop Rolling the Dice on `db push`"
  - [ ] **Content**: Briefly describe the common pains of raw database migrations:
    - Table-locking operations causing application freezes.
    - Destructive changes leading to irreversible data loss.
    - Unpredictable, long-running migrations in production.
    - The anxiety of deploying schema changes.

- [ ] **"How It Works" Section**
  - [ ] **Title**: "Your ORM, But Safer"
  - [ ] **Visual**: A 4-step visual diagram or animated graphic.
  - [ ] **Step 1: Connect**: `flow init` - Automatically detects your ORM and connects to your database.
  - [ ] **Step 2: Analyze**: `flow sync` - Intercepts your ORM's generated migration and analyzes it for risks.
  - [ ] **Step 3: Enhance**: Presents a safe, multi-step migration plan with zero-downtime strategies.
  - [ ] **Step 4: Apply**: `flow apply` - Executes the enhanced migration with pre-flight checks and progress tracking.

### **Phase 2: Feature Showcase & Examples**

- [ ] **Core Features Section**
  - [ ] **Title**: "Production-Grade Safety, Built-In"
  - [ ] Use a card-based layout to highlight key feature categories:
    - **Zero-Downtime Operations**: Explain patterns like adding columns with `NULL` first, then backfilling.
    - **Concurrent Indexing**: How `flow` avoids table locks for new indexes in PostgreSQL.
    - **Destructive Change Prevention**: Show how `flow` flags and offers alternatives to dropping columns or tables.
    - **Large Table Intelligence**: Mention chunked operations and performance warnings for tables with millions of rows.
    - **Pre-flight Simulation**: Describe the `flow test` command for dry-runs.
    - **Smart Rollbacks**: Explain the `flow back` command for safe, transactional rollbacks.

- [ ] **"Before & After" Code Comparison Section**
  - [ ] **Title**: "See The Difference"
  - [ ] An interactive component with two tabs: "Your ORM's Migration" and "The `flow` Enhanced Migration".
  - [ ] **Example 1: Adding a NOT NULL Column**
    - **Before**: A single `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... NOT NULL` statement.
    - **After**: A multi-step plan: 1. `ADD COLUMN ... NULL`, 2. `UPDATE table SET ...`, 3. `ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL`.
  - [ ] **Example 2: Creating an Index**
    - **Before**: `CREATE INDEX ...`
    - **After**: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ...` (for PostgreSQL) with a fallback explanation.
  - [ ] **Example 3: Dropping a Column**
    - **Before**: `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN ...`
    - **After**: A warning with a suggestion to use a two-phase soft-delete pattern.

### **Phase 3: Social Proof & Conversion**

- [ ] **Testimonials Section**
  - [ ] **Title**: "Trusted by Developers Who Ship Fearlessly"
  - [ ] Placeholder for 2-3 developer testimonials.
  - [ ] Example Quote: "DriftJS Flow caught a locking migration that would have taken our entire app down during peak hours. It's now a mandatory part of our deployment pipeline."

- [ ] **Integration Showcase**
  - [ ] A visually appealing grid of logos for all supported technologies.
  - **ORMs**: Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM.
  - **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.
  - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins logos with text "Integrates with your CI/CD pipeline."

- [ ] **Final CTA / Enterprise Section**
  - [ ] **Title**: "Ready to De-Risk Your Deployments?"
  - [ ] **Content**: A brief paragraph summarizing the core benefit.
  - [ ] **Primary CTA**: "Get Started for Free"
  - [ ] **Secondary CTA**: A small section for larger teams: "Need advanced features like role-based access, audit logs, and dedicated support? Check out our Enterprise plan." with a "Contact Sales" button.

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Design & UX
- **Aesthetics**: Align with the new premium, minimalistic design language established in the main landing page redesign plan. Use ambient effects, sophisticated gradients, and glassmorphism where appropriate.
- **Interactivity**: The terminal simulation and code comparison should be the hero interactive elements. They must be smooth, performant, and accessible.
- **Responsiveness**: The page must be fully responsive, with a particular focus on how the interactive elements adapt to mobile viewports.

### Technical
- **Component-Based**: Build the page using modular components (e.g., `Hero`, `FeatureCard`, `CodeComparison`).
- **Performance**: Lazy-load interactive components and images. Ensure all animations are performant and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all content and interactive elements are fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- **Visual Regression**: Use Chromatic or a similar tool to catch unintended visual changes.
- **Component Testing**: Unit test interactive components with Vitest/Jest and Testing Library.
- **E2E Testing**: Use Playwright or Cypress to test the user flow, especially the interactive terminal and CTAs.
- **User Feedback**: Conduct a brief user survey or feedback session post-launch to gauge clarity and effectiveness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Interactive elements are too complex and hurt performance.
  - **Mitigation**: Prototype the terminal and code comparison early. Use efficient libraries (like Xterm.js for the terminal) and optimize animations.
- **Risk**: The value proposition is not clear to non-expert users.
  - **Mitigation**: Use clear, benefit-oriented language. Avoid overly technical jargon in headlines. Rely on visuals and examples to do the heavy lifting.
- **Risk**: The page feels too static.
  - **Mitigation**: Lean into the planned animations and micro-interactions from the premium design system to create a dynamic, engaging feel.
